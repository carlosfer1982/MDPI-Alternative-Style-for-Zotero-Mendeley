The instructions for the scientific articles of the MDPI editorial require the writing of the DOI of each reference. This .csl file (compatible with Mendeley and Zotero) is a modification of the authorized Zotero Style Repository file that allows you to detect the DOI of each reference and configure the format automatically, being compatible with the requirements of MDPI.
